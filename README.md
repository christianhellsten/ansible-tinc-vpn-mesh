# Introduction

This sets up a tinc VPN between several servers. It also adds /etc/hosts
entries for the inventory hostnames to resolve to the VPN IP addresses.

## Prerequisites

- Root access to servers.
- Python, which is used by Ansible, needs to be installed on all servers.

## Preparation

### Create Inventory

Create a `/hosts` file with the nodes that you want to include in the VPN:

```
[vpn]
prod01 vpn_ip=10.0.0.1 ansible_host=162.243.125.98
prod02 vpn_ip=10.0.0.2 ansible_host=162.243.243.235
prod03 vpn_ip=10.0.0.3 ansible_host=162.243.249.86
prod04 vpn_ip=10.0.0.4 ansible_host=162.243.252.151

[removevpn]
```

The first line, `[vpn]`, specifies that the host entries directly below it are
part of the "vpn" group. Members of this group will have the Tinc mesh VPN
configured on them.

- The first column is where you set the inventory name of a host, "node01" in the first line of the example, how Ansible will refer to the host. This value is used to configure Tinc connections, and to generate `/etc/hosts` entries. Do not use hyphens here, as Tinc does not support them in host names
- `vpn_ip` is the IP address that the node will use for the VPN
- `ansible_host` must be set to a value that your ansible machine can reach the node at

**Note:** The inventory hostname, which we are using as each node's name in Tinc, can't contain characters that Tinc doesn't allow for node names. For example, hyphens (`-`) are not allowed.

### Review Group Variables

The `/group_vars/all` file contains a few values that you may want to modify.

- `netname` specifies the tinc netname. It's set to `vpn` by default.
- `vpn_netmask` specifies the netmask that the will be applied to the VPN interface. By default, it's set to `255.255.255.0`, which means that each `vpn_ip` is a Class C address which can only communicate with other hosts within the same subnet. For example, a `10.0.0.x` will not be able to communicate with a `10.0.1.x` host unless the subnet is enlarged by changing `vpn_netmask` to something like `255.255.0.0`.

The other variables probably don't need to be modified.

- `vpn_interface` is the virtual network interface that tinc will use. It is `tun0` by default.

## Set Up Tinc

Run the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook tinc-vpn-mesh.yml
```

After the playbook completes, all of the hosts in the inventory file should be able to communicate with each other over the VPN network.

## Quick Test

Log in to your first host and ping the second host:

```bash
ping 10.0.0.2
```

Or, assuming one of your hosts is named `prod02`, run this:

```bash
ping prod02
```

Feel free to test the other nodes.

## How to Add or Remove Servers

### Add New Servers

All servers listed in the the `[vpn]` group in the `/hosts` file will be part of the VPN. To add new VPN members, simply add the new servers to the `[vpn]` group then re-run the Playbook:

```command
ansible-playbook tinc-vpn-mesh.yml
```

### Remove Servers

To remove VPN members, move `/hosts` entries of the servers you want to remove under the `[removevpn]` group towards the bottom of the file.

For example, if we wanted to remove **node04**, the `/hosts` file would look like this:

```
[label /hosts â€” remove node04 from VPN]
[vpn]
node01 vpn_ip=10.0.0.1 ansible_host=192.0.2.55
node02 vpn_ip=10.0.0.2 ansible_host=192.0.2.240
node03 vpn_ip=10.0.0.3 ansible_host=198.51.100.4

[removevpn]
node04 vpn_ip=10.0.0.4 ansible_host=198.51.100.36
```

Save the hosts file. Note that the `vpn_ip` is optional and unused for `[removevpn]` group members.

Then re-run the Playbook:

```command
ansible-playbook tinc-vpn-mesh.yml
```

This will stop Tinc and delete the Tinc configuration and host key files from the members of the `[removevpn]` group.

Note that removing hosts from the VPN will result in orphaned tinc hosts files and /etc/hosts entries on the remaining VPN members. This should not affect anything unless you later add new servers to the VPN but reuse the decommissioned names. Delete the appropriate `/etc/hosts` entries on each server, if this is a problem for you.

## Running Multiple VPNs

This playbook does not support multiple VPNs but it could be easily extended.
